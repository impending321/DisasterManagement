                1.Check the Weather Forecast: Stay informed about weather conditions, especially if you're planning outdoor activities. Pay attention to thunderstorm warnings. <br> <br>

                2.Have a Lightning Safety Plan: Know what to do if a thunderstorm is approaching, especially if you're outdoors. Have a plan for seeking shelter. <br> <br>
                
                3.Seek Shelter: If you hear thunder or see lightning, seek shelter immediately. A sturdy building or a fully enclosed metal-topped vehicle are safe options. <br> <br>
                
                4.Avoid Water and Electrical Appliances: Lightning can travel through plumbing and electrical systems, so avoid taking baths, showers, or using electrical appliances during a storm. <br> <br>
                
                5.Unplug Electronics: Disconnect electronic devices and appliances to protect them from power surges caused by lightning strikes. <br> <br>
                
                6.Stay Away from Windows: Stay away from windows, doors, and concrete walls, as lightning can travel through these materials. <br> <br></p>

               1. Stay Indoors: Do not go outside during a lightning storm unless it's absolutely necessary. <br> <br>

               2.Avoid Water: Stay away from sinks, bathtubs, and other plumbing fixtures. Avoid swimming pools and lakes. <br> <br>

               3.Don't Use Corded Phones: Use only cordless or mobile phones during a storm. Lightning can travel through phone lines. <br> <br>

               4.Wait for the All Clear: Wait at least 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder before leaving your shelter. Lightning can strike even after a storm appears to have passed. <br> <br> </p>

               1. Assess Damage: Check for any damage to your property caused by lightning strikes, such as fires or electrical issues. <br> <br>

               2.Be Cautious: Be cautious when going outside, especially if there is debris or downed power lines. Report downed power lines to the authorities. <br> <br>

               3.Check Electronics: Inspect your electronic devices and appliances to ensure they are still functioning properly. Reconnect them if you had disconnected them before the storm. <br> <br>

               4.Monitor the Weather: Keep an eye on the weather for additional storms, especially if you are in an area prone to frequent lightning. <br> <br></p>
