                1. Know about your local relief centers and evacuation routes. <br><br>
                2. Keep emergency numbers and important information handy, as well as emergency supplies, kits, first aid items. These may include water, canned food, can opener, battery-operated radio, flashlight, and protective clothing. <br><br>
                3. Fold and roll up anything onto higher ground (or upper floors of your home), including chemicals and medicines. <br><br>
                4. Make sure everything that is of importance is secured (jewelry, documents, pets, and other valuables). <br><br>
                5. Plant trees and shrubs and keep a lot of vegetation in your compound if you are in a low-lying area as that can control erosion and help soften the speed of the flowing water.</p>

                1. Flash floods occur in a short time. As soon as they start, be quick, keep safe, and ensure that children and the elderly are safe by leaving the house to higher ground. <br><br>
                2. Turn off all electrical appliances, gas, heating, and the like if there is a bit of time. <br><br>
                3. Leave the area before it gets too late. Do not drive through the water as moving water can sweep you away. <br><br>
                4. Stay away from power lines or broken power transmission cables. <br><br>
                5. Try to keep away from floodwater as it may contain chemicals or other hazardous materials.</p>

                1. Make sure you have permission from emergency officers to get back inside your house. <br><br>
                2. Keep all power and electrical appliance off until the house is cleaned up properly and an electrician has confirmed that it is OK to put them on. <br><br>
                3. Make sure you have photographs, or a record of all the damage, as it may be needed for insurance claims. <br><br>
                4. Clean the entire home, together with all the objects in it very well before you use them again. They may be contaminated. <br><br>
                5. Wear appropriate gear (mask and gloves) before cleaning begins.</p>
